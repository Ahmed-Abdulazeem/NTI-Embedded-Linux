# CrossTool-NG Configuration Guide

## Introduction

This guide offers a concise overview and instructions for configuring CrossTool-NG, a robust cross-compilation toolchain generator. CrossTool-NG empowers users to construct custom toolchains tailored to their embedded system development requirements.

## Installation

To install CrossTool-NG, proceed with the following steps:

### 1. Clone the CrossTool-NG Repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng	
    
### 2. Navigate to the CrossTool-NG Directory:
    cd crosstool-ng

### 3. Install Dependencies:
    sudo apt install -y gcc g++ gperf bison flex texinfo help2man make libncurses5-dev python3-dev autoconf automake libtool-bin gawk wget bzip2 xz-utils unzip patch libstdc++6 rsync
    
### 4. Configure and compile CrossTool-NG:
    ./bootstrap                          # Setup the environment
    ./configure --enable-local           # Check all dependencies
    make                                 # Generate the Makefile for CrossTool-NG

## Configuration

Proceed with the following steps to configure CrossTool-NG:

### 1. List default configured Toolchains for supproted architecture:
    ./ct-ng list-samples                  # List all supported microcontrollers


### 2. Choose toolchain for required architecture:
    ./ct-ng [microcontroller]             # Configure the used microcontroller  

### 3. Initialize the CrossTool-NG configuration to change in the default configuration:
    ./ct-ng menuconfig                    # Configure the toolchain

## Building the Toolchain

### Once CrossTool-NG is configured, build the toolchain by executing:
    ./ct-ng build

## Usage

Upon successful completion of the build process, locate your custom toolchain in the directory specified during configuration (typically ~/x-tools by default). Employ this toolchain in your embedded development projects to cross-compile code for your target platform.


## Components of a toolchain

## a) Binutils

Binutils comprise essential binary tools for creating, manipulating, and managing object files, libraries, and executables within a software development environment.

## Components

### 1. Assembler (`as`)
Converts assembly language code into machine-readable object files.

### 2. Linker (`ld`)
Links multiple object files to create executables or libraries and resolves symbols across files.

### 3. Object File Utilities: 
Including **'objcopy'**, **'objdump'**, ar, aiding in object file manipulation.

### 4. Debugging Utilities: 
Such as **'nm'** for symbol listing and **'gdb'** integration.

### 5. Binary File Format Utilities: 
For **'ELF'** files and executable stripping.

## b) Kernel Headers

Kernel headers furnish necessary header files defining structures and constants essential for building kernel modules and certain user-space programs interfacing with the Linux kernel.

### Purpose

Kernel headers:
- Define data structures and constants for kernel and modules.
- Enable user-space programs to interface with the kernel.
- Provide information for compiling kernel modules.

### Components

Include headers for:

- **Linux Kernel APIs**
- **Device Drivers**
- **Networking**
- **File Systems**
- **Processor Architecture**

### Usage

Primarily during kernel module compilation and certain user-space programs.

### Sysroot

**Sysroot**  emulates the root filesystem of the target system, containing vital libraries, headers, and files crucial for compiling and linking applications targeted for the specific platform. Crosstool-NG generates this sysroot during toolchain setup.

### Components of Sysroot

`lib` , `usr/lib`: Shared and static libraries.

`usr/include:` Headers for libraries.

`usr/bin` , `usr/share`:  Utility programs and localization files.

`sbin:` Contains ldconfig for library loading optimization.


## Testing the Generated Toolchain for AVR

## 1. write source code: 
    vim main.c
    
## 2. add toolchain to PATH environment variable:     
    export PATH=${PATH}:~/x-tools/avr/bin

## 3. Compile the source code: 
  **Note:** Specify the hardware using -mmcu= 
  
    avr-gcc main.c -mmcu=atmega32a -O1 -o main
